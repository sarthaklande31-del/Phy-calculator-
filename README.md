# Python Advanced Calculator

This is my first Python project — a fully functional calculator that supports:
✔ Addition  
✔ Subtraction  
✔ Multiplication  
✔ Division (with error handling)  
✔ Power  
✔ Square Root  
✔ Percentage  
✔ Infinite loop menu system  

This project helped me understand:
- while loops  
- if-elif-else structure  
- handling user input  
- using Python's math module  
- debugging and error handling
